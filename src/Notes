Operators in java :-
1:- Increment and Decrement Operators
Increment operators are the operators who incrments the value and Decrement operators are the operators who decrements the value
They are of two types :
Post increment : - which first prints the value and then increment or decrements its value
ex - int a = 5;
System.out.println(a++); //output = 5;
Pre increment :-which first increment or decrement the value and then print it
ex - int a =5;
System.out.println(++a); //output = 6;

2:-Relational Operator = <,>,<=,>=,==

3:-Condiotional Operator = &&,||,!=

3:-BitWise Operator = it will convert all the value in bit . BitWise Operator are :- bitwise or(|) and bitwise and(&)
for ex -   //bitwise value
int a = 5; //101
int b = 6; //110
int k = a|b//111 //output = 7
// / - bitwise OR

int a = 5; //101
int b = 6; //110
int k = a&b//100
// / - bitwise AND

4:- Left Shift And Right Shift Operator : left shift operator - << , right shift operator - >>
Left shift will add the given number of zeroes at the end
ex =
int n = 4; // binary form of 4 = 100
n=n<<2; it means add 2 zeroes at the end of 100 i.e 10000 ,10000 is the binary form of 16 so output will be 16

Right shift will remove the given number of zeroes from the end
ex =
int n = 64; // binary form of 4 = 1000000
n=n>>4 // output : 4 ie 100
